/**
 * Schema for storing the Daily DSA Challenge Question
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Purpose:
 *   - Stores the mapping between a date and the DSA question assigned for that day.
 *   - Ensures only one question is assigned per date (via unique constraint).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - At midnight (12:01 AM), a random DSAQuestion is chosen and stored here.
 *   - The frontend or backend can fetch the daily challenge for a given date quickly.
 *   - Useful for tracking which problem was the official daily challenge for past dates.
